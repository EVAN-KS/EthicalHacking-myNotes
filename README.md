# 🛡️ **Cybersecurity – Introduction & Key Concepts**

---

## 🔰 **Introduction to Cybersecurity**

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. These attacks can come from hackers, viruses, or malicious software, aiming to steal, damage, or disrupt digital information.

In today’s world, where everything is connected to the internet—from smartphones to banks—**cybersecurity is more important than ever**.

## 🔴 **Red Team** – *Attack Simulators*

* These are ethical hackers who **act like real attackers**.
* Their job is to **find security flaws** by trying to break into systems.
* Helps organizations understand **how an attacker might exploit them**.

> Example: A red team might test how easy it is to hack into a company’s website.

---

## 🔵 **Blue Team** – *Defenders of the System*

* Their job is to **protect systems** from hackers.
* They monitor networks, analyze threats, and block attacks.
* They also patch software and configure firewalls properly.

> Example: A blue team may detect unusual login activity and shut it down before damage occurs.

---

## 🟣 **Purple Team** – *The Middle Ground*

* Combines the work of both Red and Blue teams.
* Helps both teams **share information and work together**.
* The goal is to **improve the organization's overall security faster**.

> Example: Red shows how they broke in, Blue improves the defense, and Purple coordinates it all.

## ⚠️ **Types of Cybersecurity Threats**

### 🎣 **Phishing**

* Fake emails or messages that trick people into giving away passwords or clicking on harmful links.

### 🦠 **Malware**

* Malicious software like viruses or ransomware that damage or lock systems.

### 👥 **Social Engineering**

* Tricking someone into giving up confidential information by pretending to be trustworthy.

### ⛓ **Man-in-the-Middle Attack**

* An attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters communication between two people.

### 💥 **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)**

* Overloads a server or website with too much traffic so that it crashes and goes offline.

### 🕳 **Zero-Day Exploits**

* Attacks that target a software vulnerability **before the developer knows about it** and can fix it.

## 🔐 **Main Areas of Cybersecurity**

### 1. **Network Security**

* Protecting the flow of data across networks using firewalls, encryption, etc.

### 2. **Application Security**

* Making sure software and apps are secure from hackers or bugs.

### 3. **Cloud Security**

* Protecting data stored in online services like Google Drive, iCloud, or AWS.

### 4. **Endpoint Security**

* Securing devices like laptops, smartphones, and desktops.

### 5. **Information Security**

* Protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access or leaks.

### 6. **Operational Security (OpSec)**

* Securing day-to-day operations, like who has access to what data and how it’s handled.

## 🧰 **Common Cybersecurity Tools**

* **Wireshark** – Analyzes what's happening on a network.
* **Nmap** – Scans networks to find open ports and weaknesses.
* **Burp Suite** – Finds bugs in websites and web applications.
* **Snort** – Detects attacks or unusual activity on a network.
* **John the Ripper** – Tests password strength by attempting to crack them.

## 🔐 **Cybersecurity Best Practices**

* 🔑 Use **strong and unique passwords**.
* 🔒 Enable **two-factor authentication (2FA)**.
* 📦 Keep your **software updated**.
* 🚫 Don’t click on **suspicious emails or popups**.
* ☁️ Always **back up your data**.
* 🧠 Be aware of **basic scams and tricks** used by attackers.
